## M5-B Planning (Integration Patterns and Multi-Host Support)

Queue definition pending. Planned scope:
1. Define host adapter interface and contract
2. Add integration patterns guide (async loop, error handling, resize coordination)
3. Plan conformance patterns for multiple host types

Guardrail: One ticket per commit. Mandatory validation per ticket:
- `zig build`
- `zig build test`
- `rg -n "compat[^ib]|fallback|workaround|shim" --glob '*.zig' src`
- `test ! -f src/main.zig`
- `find src -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.zig' | rg -n 'src/(conformance|ops|perf|reliability|snapshot)\.zig' || true`
