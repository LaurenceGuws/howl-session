# Transport API Contract

## Scope

This contract defines the host-neutral transport seam consumed by `howl-session`.
It does not define platform specifics (PTY, pipes, sockets, or OS APIs).
It does not define terminal semantics or rendering concerns.

M2 progress split:
- M2-A/B delivered seam contracts and deterministic in-memory/test adapters.
- M2-C closes Unix PTY/process adapter execution under the same seam.

## Ownership Boundaries

- `howl-session` consumes the transport seam; it does not own transport implementations.
- Concrete transport adapters (PTY, in-memory, pipe) implement this seam and are owned by host or platform layers.
- Session is decoupled from all platform specifics via this seam.

## Interface

The transport seam is expressed as a vtable-backed interface type (`Transport`) with an opaque pointer to the concrete implementation.
Session holds an optional `?Transport`; a null transport means no transport is attached.

## Types

### `TransportError`

Error values that transport operations may return:
- `AlreadyStarted` — start called on an already-running transport
- `NotStarted` — write/read/resize called before start
- `WriteFailed` — write operation rejected by transport
- `ReadFailed` — read operation rejected by transport
- `ResizeFailed` — resize notification rejected by transport

## Transport Boundaries

### start

- Signature: `start() anyerror!void`
- Activates the transport; subsequent write/read/resize calls are valid.
- Returns `error.AlreadyStarted` if called on an active transport.

### stop

- Signature: `stop() void`
- Deactivates the transport; write/read/resize are not valid after stop returns.
- Idempotent on an already-stopped transport.

### write

- Signature: `write(bytes: []const u8) anyerror!usize`
- Delivers bytes from session to the transport peer.
- Returns count of bytes accepted; a partial write is a valid result.
- Call only valid on a started transport.

### read

- Signature: `read(buf: []u8) anyerror!usize`
- Reads bytes available from the transport peer into `buf`.
- Returns count of bytes read; returns 0 if no bytes are available (non-blocking).
- Call only valid on a started transport.

### resize

- Signature: `resize(cols: u16, rows: u16) anyerror!void`
- Delivers a terminal dimension change notification to the transport peer.
- Call only valid on a started transport.

### control

- Signature: `control(signal: ControlSignal) void`
- Routes a typed control signal to the transport peer.
- No terminal semantic reinterpretation; signal semantics are transport-defined.
- Fire-and-forget: no error channel is provided.
- Before start/after stop behavior is adapter-defined.

## Unix PTY/Process Adapter Guarantees

The Unix PTY adapter (`UnixPtyTransport`) is the canonical process-based transport implementation.

### Platform Guarantees

- Linux and macOS only; `init()` returns `error.UnsupportedPlatform` on all other targets.
- Uses system `openpty` and `fork` APIs; no fallback or emulation.

### Lifecycle Guarantees

- `start()` forks a child process, allocates a PTY master fd, sets it non-blocking, and spawns a shell.
- Multiple `start()` calls without intervening `stop()` return `error.AlreadyStarted` with no state change.
- `stop()` is idempotent: signals the child with SIGTERM, reaps with timeout, closes fds, and succeeds whether or not process had already exited.
- Child process lifecycle (SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGWINCH) is deterministic and bounded; no orphaned processes after `stop()`.

### I/O Guarantees

- `read()` is non-blocking: returns 0 if no bytes available; never blocks on started transport.
- `write()` is non-blocking: returns WouldBlock as 0 bytes written; never blocks.
- Both return `error.NotStarted` if called before `start()` or after `stop()`.
- Partial writes are valid: callers must loop.

### Resize and Control Guarantees

- `resize()` updates TIOCSWINSZ on the master fd; failure returns `error.ResizeFailed`.
- `control()` sends signals to child process; before start or after stop is safe (no-op).
- Both are deterministic and cannot corrupt transport state.

## Stop Conditions

Engineer must stop and report if any transport boundary requires:
- SDL or renderer types to express any parameter or return value.
- terminal-core semantic changes to satisfy the transport contract.
